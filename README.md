# Dotnetcore-React-Redux  
  
This project is a sample web application project that uses...  
- C# based ASP.NET Core for Backend API  
- React for UI framework  
- Redux for state managing  
- Typescript instead of javascript  
  
## Goals  
- Make sample web site with username/password authentication feature.  
- All backend requests including login/logout/registration will make API call.  
- Frontend should use react + redux by Typescript.  
- All functions, classes, methods and others should be appropriately commented.  
- For educational reason, no `var` keyword is allowed.
